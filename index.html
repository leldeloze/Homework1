                    If you have kids, or have kids on the way, having a pet at a young age can lower their risk of getting
                    allergies. Not only to pet hair, but according to the National Institute of Health, pet exposure at a
                    young
                    age can also prevent "other types of common allergies, such as allergy to dust mites, ragweed, and
                    grass."
                    Cats can have a bunch of positive effects on children. According to Care.com, owning a cat can teach
                    kids
                    social skills and help them cope with traumatic situations. Don't be fooled by all the fluff and fur,
                    cats
                    are natural predators. Despite being domesticated, they still have that hunter instinct and will keep
                    your
                    home free of mice.

                    In a study of self-proclaimed dog-lovers versus cat-lovers done at Carroll University in Waukesha,
                    Wisconsin, cat owners scored higher on intelligence than dog owners did. Cats do sleep a lot, but even
                    when
                    they're snoozing, they still stay super alert. They're actively hearing and smelling things while
                    asleep, so
                    that they're able to pounce on a pest at a moment's notice. Plenty of apartments allow cats because
                    they’re
                    quiet, so they are less likely to wake the neighbors up when someone rings your doorbell. Unlike our
                    friend
                    Fido, Whiskers doesn't require multiple walks a day. Older cats can also be left alone for a day or two
                    if
                    they have access to their food, water, and litter box. Of course, make sure you speak with your
                    veterinarian
                    beforehand.

                    Ever wonder why cats love to play? Since they don't hunt for their food, it's believed kitties have an
                    abundance of energy stored up and release it through playtime. Cats are a lot smarter than people make
                    them
                    out to be. According to Animal Planet, cats are constantly learning and have an excellent memory. When
                    you
                    head off to work and need to leave your pet behind, you may start to feel a little guilty. But it might
                    be
                    easier with a cat who loves having the house to themselves. Cats will sleep whenever they’re bored
                    about
                    15 hours a day.

                    Since cats don’t eat nearly as much meat as dogs do, it results in a much smaller carbon footprint.
                    While
                    definitely smaller, both animals have carbon footprints equivalent to cars, according to some
                    sustainability
                    authors. A study found that cats drink water "gracefully," so if you have misophonia a.k.a. you hate the
                    sound of chewing (and/or drinking), you may want to get a cat. Research shows cats can help lower your
                    blood
                    pressure and reduce the risk of dying from a heart attack. It's amazing knowing that one of these cuties
                    is
                    keeping you healthy. Not only is purring absolutely adorable, but it can also be a soothing sound for
                    humans. In fact, there are numerous online videos of cats just purring to help people fall asleep.

                    Egyptian history shows that cats worked hard to be welcomed into homes. But people eventually noticed
                    that
                    the animals resembled Bast, the Ancient Egyptian goddess of warfare, and they started to be held in high
                    regard. There are few things in life more heartbreaking than losing a pet, which is why knowing that the
                    average domestic cat has an average lifespan of about 15 years is quite comforting.
